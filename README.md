# swetha1204--Missing-Child-Identification-using-Deep-Learning-and-MultiClass-SVM

# summary

● This project presents the use of deep learning methodology for identifying the reported missing child from the photos of multitude of children available, with the help of face recognition. ● The public can upload photographs of suspicious child into a common portal with landmarks and remarks. ● The system compares these photos with a database of missing children using face recognition. ● It uses a technique called Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to extract facial features and a trained SVM classifier to identify the missing child, outperforming previous method.
